Gamification System:

 One of the most distinctive features of this application is the integration of gamification mechanics:

 - Users can earn coins either by completing car reservations or by participating in an in-built mini car racing game.

Technical Highlights:

 - Developed fully in Java, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming principles for clean and scalable code architecture.

 - Backed by a relational database consisting of multiple normalized tables to support users, reservations, vehicle inventory, gamification rewards, and more.

 - Smooth integration of mapping APIs and external services for enhanced user interaction.

 - Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing for easy future additions such as mobile support or payment gateways.

This project demonstrates strong command over Java-based application development, full-stack logic implementation, integration of third-party APIs, gamification design, and database management. It showcases a creative, user-focused approach to solving a traditional business problem by enhancing engagement and retention through interactive features.
